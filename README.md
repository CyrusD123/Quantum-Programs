# Demonstrating Quantum Properties
For my genre, I have created four different programs to demonstrate superposition, entanglement, and the random errors of qubits.
You can check out the complete source code for each program in the repository above. The following will be a brief summary and analysis of each program.


# The Base - Quantum.py
Quantum.py is the basis for all of the other programs in this genre. It is written using Qiskit, a program that simulates a quantum computer on your own computer or connects to an IBM quantum computer over the Cloud.
